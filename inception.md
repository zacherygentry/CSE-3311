# Project Vision

We are creating a multi-platform mobile app which focuses on image recognition capabilities in an educational environment. Our app focuses both on text and drawn image recognition and being cross-platform for both iOS and Android. Our app's main feature is recognizing text and images from a drawn source. The app allows for users to go through exercises where they draw or write out a given word or shape and is then checked against our image recognition APIs to see if the user is correct.
