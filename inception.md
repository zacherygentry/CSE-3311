# Project Vision

We are creating a multi-platform mobile app which focuses on image recognition capabilities in an educational environment. Our app focuses both on text and drawn image recognition and being cross-platform for both iOS and Android. Our app's main feature is recognizing text and images from a drawn source. The app allows for users to go through exercises where they draw or write out a given word or shape and is then checked against our image recognition APIs to see if the user is correct.

# Top 3 Risks
* Beginners to app development  
* Short duration to develop the full vision of the application  
* We want to use openCVL but we are not sure how well it will work cross-platforms

# Competitors
* PocketPhonics


# Use Cases and UI Layout
1) 5 lesson plans  
	a) letters (a-z)  
	b) number (1-100)  
	c) shapes  
	d) words (school words)  
	e) math (add, subtract)  
2) SQLite database
3) Android and iOS
4) Produces audio
5) Capture screen images
6) Validates images for correctness
