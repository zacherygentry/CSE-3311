# Project Vision

We are creating a multi-platform mobile app which focuses on image recognition capabilities in an educational environment. Our app focuses both on text and drawn image recognition and being cross-platform for both iOS and Android. Our app's main feature is recognizing text and images from a drawn source. The app allows for users to go through exercises where they draw or write out a given word or shape and is then checked against our image recognition APIs to see if the user is correct.

# Top 3 Risks
Beginners to app development  
Short duration to develop the full vision of the application  
We want to use openCVL but we are not sure how well it will work cross-platforms
