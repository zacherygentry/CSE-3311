#  Iteration 1: edU

# Exciting Features and Implementation

# Compititors and How edU differs

* PocketPhonics
  	* Is a learning app, that encourages the child to explore the alphabet by tracing the image of the letter. They also have an option of choosing the letter after hearing the corresponding audio.
* Scribble Cards
	* Scribble Cards is similar to PocketPhonics, but also incorporates numbers, as well as, the alphabet. Scribble Cards, on the other hand, does not include an audio learning feature.
* Trace It, Try It
	* Is a handwriting app that teaches children to trace over pre-drawn alphabets, numbers (0-20), and simple three letter words.
  
How edU differs

* Reason 1: edU combines a greater range of exercises: numbers, letters, simple spelling, shapes and math. 
Which eliminates the need to download multiple apps and frees up space on the Users phone.

* Reason 2: edU uses Tesseract to apply text and image recognition, eliminating the need for tracing over a preshown object. This allows creativity and the chance to execute their own unique writing styles.

* Reason 3: edU will allow the developer to upgrade lessons and increase the contents of the database. Unlike the other competitors, edU evolves over time, incorporating new and exciting features.

* Reason 4: edU ranges in terms of difficulty levels. Other competitors have a smaller age range, whereas, edU ages range from 2 and up.

# The Five Top Risk

* Risk 1:    Each team member are beginners in App Development.
  * Risk Exposure: RE = 90% * 10hr = 9hr
  * Solution: The team will engage in intensive training and research to gain knowledge in app development. This will be implemented immediately prior to coding.

* Risk 2:    Making the app visually appealing to a younger audience.
  * Risk Exposure: RE = 90% * 9hr = 8.1hr
  * Solution: Since the app is geared towards a younger audience, the team will use fun, bright colors and images to keep the student captivated and engaged. This will be implemented after the major requirements have been implemented.

* Risk 3:    The team is not sure how openCVL and Tesseract will behave cross-platforms.
  * Risk Exposure: RE = 70% * 8hr = 5.6hr
  * Solution: The team will test the following software on both platforms to gauge itâ€™s cross-platforming ability. This will be implemented simultaneously to Risk 1.

* Risk 4:    Short duration to develop the full vision of the app.
  * Risk Exposure: RE = 60% * 5hr = 3hr
  * Solution: The team will remove as many requirements as possible while still maintaining the integrity of the app. This will be implemented in iteration 3.

* Risk 5:    A few team members have busy schedules, making frequent meetings difficult.
  * Risk Exposure: 60% * 3hr = 1.8hr
  * Solution: The team will each write down their schedule to have a clear view of when every member is free to accurately schedule a meeting. The will be implemented immediately.
